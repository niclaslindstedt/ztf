# Updating the Docs

The `docs/` directory contains conceptual documentation for ztf. Unlike the README (overview) or man pages (command reference), `docs/` explains *why* and *how* in depth. It goes stale whenever a user-visible behavior, configuration key, or supported surface changes without a matching edit.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agent/skills/update-docs/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the repository's initial commit.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agent/skills/update-docs/.last-updated)
   ```

2. List commits since the baseline:

   ```sh
   git log --oneline "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

3. List changed files:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

4. Categorize using the mapping table below.

## Mapping table

| Changed files / scope | Doc(s) to update |
|---|---|
| Public API surface | `docs/getting-started.md`, architecture-level docs |
| Configuration keys / env vars | `docs/configuration.md` |
| Error messages and exit codes | `docs/troubleshooting.md` |
| Deployment / install mechanics | `docs/getting-started.md` |

Extend this table every time you find a new source file that feeds the docs.

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read baseline from `.last-updated` and run `git log` / `git diff --name-only`
- [ ] Read every affected `docs/*.md` file
- [ ] Walk the mapping table and update each doc in place
- [ ] Verify cross-links between docs still resolve
- [ ] Verify every shell example is still syntactically valid
- [ ] Run `make test` and the project's conformance check
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agent/skills/update-docs/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Re-read every edited doc section against the current source of truth.
2. Click every internal cross-link and confirm the target still exists.
3. Confirm `.last-updated` was rewritten.

## Skill self-improvement

1. **Grow the mapping table** with any new source → doc relationship you discovered.
2. **Record recurring patterns** you had to invent.
3. **Commit the skill edit** alongside the docs change so the knowledge compounds.
