# Updating the README

`README.md` is the primary user-facing documentation for ztest. It covers installation, quick start, the feature list, and any user-visible defaults. It goes stale whenever a CLI flag, subcommand, default, or supported surface changes without a matching edit.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agent/skills/update-readme/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the initial commit of the repository.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agent/skills/update-readme/.last-updated)
   ```

2. List commits since the baseline:

   ```sh
   git log --oneline "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

3. List changed files:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

4. Categorize the changes using the mapping table below.

5. Read the current `README.md` so you can preserve voice and unrelated sections while editing.

## Mapping table

| Changed files / scope | README section(s) to update |
|---|---|
| Public API surface | **Usage** / **Quick start** |
| CLI flags or subcommands | **Usage** table |
| Default configuration | **Quick start** |
| Installation instructions / package name | **Install** |
| New supported platform or language | **Supported platforms** list |
| License change | **License** section, badges |

Extend this table every time you find a new source-of-truth file that feeds the README.

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read baseline from `.last-updated` and run `git log` / `git diff --name-only`
- [ ] Read the current `README.md`
- [ ] Walk the mapping table and update each affected section
- [ ] Verify every shell example is still syntactically valid
- [ ] Run `make test` and the project's own conformance check
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agent/skills/update-readme/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Re-read every edited section against the corresponding source of truth.
2. Confirm `.last-updated` was rewritten with the new `HEAD`.

## Skill self-improvement

After a run, improve this file in place:

1. **Grow the mapping table** with any new source → README relationship you discovered.
2. **Record patterns** for recurring edits.
3. **Commit the skill edit** together with the README edit so the knowledge compounds.
