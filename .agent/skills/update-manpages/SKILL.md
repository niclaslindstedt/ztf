# Updating the Manpages

`man/` contains the reference-style command documentation shipped with ztf — one markdown file per command. These pages are the authoritative command-level reference and rot whenever a flag, subcommand, or default changes without a matching edit.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agent/skills/update-manpages/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the repository's initial commit.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agent/skills/update-manpages/.last-updated)
   ```

2. List commits since the baseline:

   ```sh
   git log --oneline "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

3. List changed files:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD
   ```

4. Categorize using the mapping table below.

## Mapping table

| Changed files / scope | Manpage(s) to update |
|---|---|
| CLI parser (new or renamed subcommand) | Top-level `man/ztf.md`; create a new `man/<cmd>.md` if missing |
| CLI parser (new flag on existing command) | The corresponding command section |
| Global flags | `man/ztf.md` Global Flags section |
| Default values or error messages | The affected command section |

Extend this table every time you find a new source file that feeds the manpages.

## Format conventions

Preserve these when editing:

- H1 title matches `ztf man <cmd>` output.
- Standard sections in order: Synopsis → Description → Arguments → Flags → Examples → See Also.
- Synopsis and flag blocks are 4-space indented code blocks (not fenced).
- See Also entries point at related commands with one-line descriptions.

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read baseline from `.last-updated` and run `git log` / `git diff --name-only`
- [ ] Read the CLI parser source file for the current flag definitions
- [ ] Read every affected `man/*.md`
- [ ] Update command-level flags, defaults, and examples
- [ ] Create `man/<cmd>.md` for any new subcommand
- [ ] Run `make test` — manpage parity tests must pass
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agent/skills/update-manpages/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Build and run `ztf man <cmd>` for every edited page.
2. Compare every flag block against the CLI parser source.
3. Confirm `.last-updated` was rewritten.

## Skill self-improvement

1. **Grow the mapping table** with any new source → manpage relationship you discovered.
2. **Record format quirks** (e.g. alignment rules) you had to normalize.
3. **Commit the skill edit** alongside the manpage edits.
