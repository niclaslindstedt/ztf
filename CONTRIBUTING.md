# Contributing to ztest

Thanks for your interest! This document describes how to set up a dev
environment, the conventions we follow, and how to get a change merged.

## Prerequisites

- _Exact tooling versions._

## Getting the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/ztest.git
cd ztest
```

## Build, test, lint

```sh
make build
make test
make lint
make fmt-check
```

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>`.
3. Make focused commits using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <summary>
   ```
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`,
   `build`, `style`. Breaking changes: `<type>!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
4. Open a PR. The **PR title** must be conventional-commit format because we
   squash-merge and that title becomes the commit message on `main`.
5. CI must be green and at least one reviewer must approve.

## Tests

_Where tests live, what coverage is expected, how to run a single test._

## Documentation

If your change touches user-visible behavior, update the relevant `docs/`
topic and the README quick start. See `AGENTS.md` for the full sync table.
